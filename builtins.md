## Built-in Functions

Neko comes with a considerable number of built-in functions, all of which begin with `$`. Most of these are for manipulating [arrays](arrays.html), [hash tables](hashtables.html), [strings](strings.html), [functions](functions.html), [numbers](numbers.html), and [objects](objects.html).

There are also functions for checking [abstracts](http://nekovm.org/doc/view/builtins#abstract) and some useful [miscellaneous](http://nekovm.org/doc/view/builtins#other) operations.

These functions are more efficient and optimized than typical Neko functions would be, so it is typically preferable to use one of these when you can.
