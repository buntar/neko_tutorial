## Built-in Functions

Neko comes with a considerable number of built-in functions, all of which begin with `$`. Most of these are for manipulating [arrays], [hash tables], [strings], [functions], [numbers], and [objects].

There are also functions for checking [abstracts](http://nekovm.org/doc/view/builtins#abstract) and some useful [miscellaneous](http://nekovm.org/doc/view/builtins#other) operations.

These functions are more efficient and optimized than typical Neko functions would be, so it is typically preferable to use one of these when you can.
