## Program Structure

Neko programs are fairly loose in their structure. Variable declarations, function definitions, and instructions may be essentially placed anywhere. Code outside any functions is at the top-level and will be executed as it is encountered.

## Built-in Functions

Neko comes with many built-in functions, all of which begin with a dollar sign (`$`). More information about built-ins can be found [here](builtins.html). These functions are always available and may be used anywhere.

## Control Constructs

Neko has several flow control constructs: `if`, `while`, `do-while`, `switch`, and `goto` are all available.
